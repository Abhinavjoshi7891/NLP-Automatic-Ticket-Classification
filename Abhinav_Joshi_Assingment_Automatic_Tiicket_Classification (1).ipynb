Just looking to have this corrected and moved from all credit reporting company 's as promised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          9\n",
       "This particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application. I highly recommend you generate verification that Credit Union has been reported completely in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act regulations, it's really a serious problem to misreport. More confirmation of the aforesaid item too. My proper request must over, I was never 30 days/60 days/120 days late in any of my payments and I'm not greatly tuned in to the date opened so I prefer to ask you be investigated as soon as possible and confirmed to be correct.

       "We had a home equity line of credit for 5 years that expired in XXXX 2016, with a balloon payment due of {$240000.00} which we received a letter in the mail a week before the expiry date telling us that our payment was due. I immediately went to see my local bank and he could not help us, because we were a member of private banking and he could not even see our information. So, he then gave us a name for a loan officer, which we called when we got home and sent him all our paperwork, he then determined that we would not be eligible for a mortgage because my husband had a year before that lost his job with the company he had been with for 30 years, because the company moved back to XXXX. My husband was working, but only making half the money, so he suggested that if we pay our car loan, we would qualify for pre approval. We took our savings and paid the loan, and called him after it was paid, he then said the loan had been sent to collections and he could not help us. I then went back to my local bank and asked to speak with another loan officer and after one week, she called us back saying she also could not help us, we had to contact collections. I have spoke to maybe XXXX different people, gone to our local bank 3 times, spoke with a lady from the executive office once and she also said she could not help us and had no interest in helping, I called her supervisor and we did not receive a call back. Before this happened, our credit was very good and we had missed 1 payment, which was a few days late, in the whole 5 years of this loan. Because of all this fooling around, they have reported us to the credit bureau as late and this has taken a bad hit on our credit. They now do not want to give us another loan and offered to possibly have a second look and see if we qualified for the hardship remodification loan and he said it 's not sure we will get it, you have to be under a certain salary, we can pay our payments, my husband is making good money, that is not the problem and i told this to the bank. We did not realize going into this at 5 years, we would have to pay back the whole {$240000.00} we were not made aware of this, oh it was probably in the fine print of the contract, but i do n't understand that jargon and relied on the loan officer at the time to tell me this and he failed to do so. We are not faced with a foreclosure and need help immediately. Please help!        1\n",
       "Dear XXXX, I am filing a complaint against Chase Bank 's decision of the refusal to our chargeback against XXXX XXXX who lured us to make a deposit to their oversea bank in the amount of {$15000.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Half year later, XXXX XXXX closed our trading account and refused us to make a withdrawal. By the XXXX XXXX, we still had over {$70000.00} in that account but can not access to it. \\n\\nI told Chase Bank XXXX XXXX employee XXXX that XXXX was doing illegal financial activities in XXXX and they failed to deliver their promised service to their customer. Chase just ignored the fact and even did n't take a investigation. They just simply told me that the time frame to file a chargeback was 120 days and I have passed the valid time frame. I told them I was filing my claim for a refund under the XXXX XXXX XXXX which allow us have 540 days from the date we sent the money when was XXXX XXXX. But XXXX just ignored this Scheme and repeatedly told me I passed 120 days time frame. They even did n't know what XXXX XXXX XXXX is. I suggest them study the XXXX XXXX XXXX and take a close investigation at my case.

       "21   on xxxx xxxx i made a  payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on xxxx explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "21   on xxxx xxxx i made a  payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on xxxx explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",
